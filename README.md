The purpose is to implement and evaluate the Q-Learning algorithm for a grid-based
reinforcement learning problem. The goal is to understand how Q-Learning can be used to find an optimal
policy for an agent navigating through a grid environment with obstacles, a goal state, and a trap state. The
assignment also aims to explore the effects of varying hyperparameters such as the discount factor (γ) and the
exploration rate (ε) on the learning process and the resulting policy.
